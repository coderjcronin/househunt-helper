# househunt-helper
A utility application to assist with saving homes/apartments/etc from listing sites and adding your own notes/photos.

## Overview
This utility will help user(s) track potential accomodations to rent or purchase. It will allow tracking of the user(s) needs (space, amenties, parking, etc.), if the property has an HOA (and what the HOA is), whom to contact (if the user is not using a leasing or real estate agent), links to listing sites, and allow the user to track impressions of open houses or walkthroughs. Potential future use is to allow crowd sourcing of walkthroughs to show parts of the accomodation leasing agents or property managers may wish to play down (such as poor draining, local nuisances, etc.)

## Quick Setup
*Will flesh out later, most probably mounting docker image and pointing to sqlite instance*

## Manual Setup
*I haven't fleshed out quick setup, you want in depth? Get a time machine and read what this gets updated to*
